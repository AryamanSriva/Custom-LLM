# Creating Custom LLMs

This project focuses on building and comparing simple n-gram models and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate realistic-sounding names from scratch. We start with bigram and trigram models, then implement an RNN for text generation to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks in language modeling.
